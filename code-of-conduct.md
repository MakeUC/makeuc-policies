 **Hybrid Hackathon Code of Conduct**

**Respect and Inclusion**
Respect for all participants: Whether you're participating in person or virtually, treat everyone with dignity and respect. Harassment, discrimination, and bullying will not be tolerated.
Inclusive environment: We value diversity in every form. This event is open to individuals from all backgrounds, experiences, and identities. Discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or any other status is prohibited.
Virtual and in-person equality: Everyone should have the same opportunities to participate and contribute, regardless of their mode of participation. Ensure that virtual participants have access to the same resources, support, and engagement as those on-site.

**Professionalism**
Communication is key: Maintain professionalism in all interactions, whether in the event’s chat rooms, social media, or in-person interactions. Clear, positive, and constructive communication fosters a collaborative environment.
Collaboration over competition: Focus on teamwork, mentorship, and learning. Disrespectful or competitive behaviors will not be tolerated.
Harassment-free environment: Harassment, whether virtual (e.g., chat, video) or physical, will not be tolerated. We want everyone to feel safe and comfortable engaging in the hackathon.

**Virtual & In-Person Interaction**
Remote participation fairness: Virtual participants should have access to all necessary tools, including hackathon platforms, chat channels, and technical support. Virtual teams should be equally visible and included in all activities, such as live discussions and pitch sessions.
Professional appearance and behavior (virtual): If you're joining the event virtually, ensure that your environment is free of distractions. Mute your microphone when not speaking, and be mindful of background noise.
Respect in-person spaces: Participants on-site should respect the physical space, follow any venue guidelines, and adhere to social distancing and health protocols, if applicable. Treat online participants as equals, and don't engage in conversations that exclude them.

**Integrity and Accountability**
Honesty in your work: All participants must adhere to principles of honesty and integrity in their work. Using others' code or work without proper attribution, engaging in cheating or plagiarism, and misrepresenting yourself or your work will not be tolerated.
Follow intellectual property rules: Only use tools and resources you're authorized to use, and respect the licenses and permissions provided by sponsors and third parties.

**Health, Safety & Well-being**
Mental health matters: Both in-person and virtual participants should prioritize self-care. Hackathons can be intense, so take breaks, stay hydrated, and manage your time well.
Follow health protocols (physical event): Participants attending in-person events must follow any health, safety, or COVID-19-related guidelines, such as wearing masks, sanitizing hands, and maintaining social distance.
Report concerns immediately: Whether virtual or in-person, if you experience or witness any kind of harassment or misconduct, report it to the organizers immediately. We are here to provide support and resolve issues promptly.

**Compliance with Event Rules**
Follow all event guidelines: Adhere to the event’s rules, including timelines for submission, project requirements, and judging criteria. Any failure to comply with the event's regulations could result in disqualification.
Sponsor guidelines: When using resources, tools, APIs, or cloud credits from sponsors, follow the guidelines and limitations provided. Violating these can result in penalties or disqualification.

**Engagement and Feedback**
Engage with both online and on-site participants: Encourage hybrid networking, collaboration, and participation. Be sure virtual participants have opportunities to connect with others, ask questions, and showcase their work.
Be constructive: Provide helpful, positive feedback during interactions. Whether you're mentoring or sharing feedback during presentations, your aim should be to help others improve and grow.

**Consequences**
Participants found violating the Code of Conduct—whether online or in person—may face consequences, including disqualification from the event, removal from the platform, or exclusion from future events. Serious violations may result in permanent bans from participating in future hackathons or similar events.
